1. Find IP public address that using github pages to use their subdomain, but not properly config using dnsdumster.com/subfinder
2. If Founded, get freedns and registered that IP to this DNS that we created
3. Create new Repo to provide that html to check if takeover is success
4. Run that dns already we created in github pages
